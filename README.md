# Week-1-RTL-Design-Gate-Level-Synthesis-GLS-
Author: T Tushar Shenoy  In this program, I explore designing a RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, this journey empowers participants to build silicon and contribute to the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.
